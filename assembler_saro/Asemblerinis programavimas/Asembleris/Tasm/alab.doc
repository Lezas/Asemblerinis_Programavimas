0.1 - Disclaimer
----------------

Assembler Laboratory is provided "as is" and without any warranty.
To the extent premitted under applicable law, I disclaim all warranties,
express or implied, including but not limited to, any implied warranty
of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Specifically, I
make no representation or warranty that the software is fit for any
particular purpose.

I shall not be liable for any damages resulting from the use of this
software, including but not limited to, loss of profit, data or use of
the software, or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages
or other similar claims, even if I has been specifically advised of the
possibility of such damages.

What it means:
The only thing I guarantee Alab will do, is to take up space on your
harddisk.

0.2 - Registration (and what you get)
-------------------------------------

Assembler Laboratory is provided as SHAREWARE (read SHAREWRE.TXT for
information about shareware). If you continue using Alab after a 30 day
trial period, you MUST PURCHASE a license for it. The advantage about
shareware, is that you can use the program for a specified number of
days/months to see if you like it, and then pay for it if you do and
would like to use it further.

In version 1.0 I had forgot to include an educational license, and the
need for such a license became obvious as some colleges wanted to
purchase Alab. I heard that there had also been some problems with
paying from forreign countries, but this and the educational license
should be in order in this version.

There are 3 different licenses which comes with Alab, each for different
areas of use:

1 : A non-commercial license. You purchase this license if you want to
    use Alab in development of non-commercial programs. Development of
    shareware is also included in this license.

2 : A commercial license. You purchase this license if you want to use
    Alab in development of commercial programs (should be obvious:).
    From this version and on, a company needs to purchase 1 copy for
    every computer Alab is going to be used on. There is a discount for
    this license if you purchase several copies. There is more
    information in ORDER.FRM.

3 : An educational license. This license is for institutions
    (schools/colleges...) which want to use Alab for educational
    purposes. The institution must purchase one copy for every
    workstation (computer) Alab is going to be used on. There is a
    discount for this license. See ORDER.FRM for more information.

The non-commercial registration fee for Alab is set to just $15 (USD).
The commercial registration fee is set to $60 (USD).
The educational registration fee is ($15 * number of copies) / 2 (that
is, a discount of %50).

Norwegians:
Ikke-kommersiell registrerings pris er 100,- NKR.
Kommersiell registrerings pris er 460,- NKR.
Utdanning registrerings pris er 50,- NKR * antall kopier.

All prices includes disk, envelope and stamp.

TO REGISTER ALAB, DO THE FOLLOWING:

  - Print out the order form (ORDER.FRM) and fill it out.
  - Print out license.txt (read it ofcourse) and sign it
  - Mail them both to HAAVARD ENGUM (the address is at the end of this
    document, and in order.frm).
  - The registration fee can be paid in cash, cheque or money-transfer
    to "giro" bank or postgiro accounts:

      Bank account ("giro" bank) : 82306010944
      Post account (postgiro)    : 08250698330

    Make it payable to :

    Groenbech
    Sigrid Johansens v.23
    7025 Trondheim
    NORWAY

  NBNB!! I believe this was the problem from forreign countries..(?) If
  this doesn't work, YOU HAVE TO SEND A CHEQUE TO HAAVARD ENGUM along
  with order.frm and license.txt.

       - MAKE SURE YOU MAKE IT PAYABLE TO: -

    Kurt Inge Gr›nbech
    Sigrid Johansens v.23
    7025 Trondheim
    NORWAY

When Haavard then recieves order.frm and a signed license.txt (and you
have paid the fee), he will send a registered version to you by either
snailmail or email.

WHAT YOU GET:

The first thing you should notice, is that I have *not* put any delays
or big screens with registration encouragements in there. The reason is
simply because I especially hate such delays myself!! I have the
opportunity to tell you right here now:) I have put *many* ours of work
into Alab, and would like to get something in return. It _you_ find Alab
useful, I hope you will appreciate my many hours of work on this project
and register. If you do, you support the development of Alab, and there
is already a better chance you will see a new version of Alab. You can
then also be sure that all your suggestions will be given high priority.

The shareware version of Alab comes with lack of 3 features.

What you get by registering:
  - A personalised disk with a registered version of Alab if you prefer
    to get it by snailmail, or a registered version sent to you by email.
  - Max 15 windows open (4 in the shareware version)
  - Possibility to Save/Restore desktop when not using Project.
  - Possibility to save bookmarks.

I couldn't figure out something else ;)

0.3 - Upgrading
---------------

(NB! This is from the next version and on. I will send all of you who
have already registered yourself a registered version 1.2!)

Don't delete your already received .KEY-file!!

If you already have registered yourself, you can upgrade your registered
version by paying a small upgrade fee of US $5 (30,- NKR).
You just have to fill out UPGRADE.FRM (you don't have to print it out,
you can send it by e-mail!) and pay the fee. I will send you Alab when
I (or Haavard Engum) have checked that you have payed the fee. Although,
if you must send a cheque you also can send UPGRADE.FRM along with it.

WE *WILL* CHECK THAT YOU ARE ALREADY A REGISTERED USER, but even if we
didn't you wouldn't be able to use it because it must have a .KEY-file
which only registered users have.

0.4 - Distribution
------------------

Distribution of Alab must happen under these conditions:

    - Alab should be distributed in its original archive.
      (the ZIP-file YOU recive, is the ZIP file YOU should distribute)
      If impossible, the ZIP-file you distribute must contain all files
      which belongs to Alab that you recieved.

    - No money can be charged for it, EXCEPT a little amount for the
      disk or similar.

0.5 - Acknowledgements
----------------------

Many hours have gone into the development of this product, and I have
got many a useful id‚a from various betatesters. Especially I would like
to thank the following people for extensive betatesting:

  - Tor-Helge Skei              (Axon/         Xenon), Main betatester

(hmm.. guess there's only 1 _extensive_ betatester!)
Actually, Axon is the main reason you've got a product named Alab on
your computer!

[ 1 - Introduction ]
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

1.1 - About this reference manual
---------------------------------

This documentation is inteded as a short overview of Alab and I will
therefore not go too much into details, thus I recon most of you out
there know how to handle an IDE (I believe most of you have already
tried different IDE's). I will instead try to focus on the various extra
features which you have at your disposal in Alab.

2 statements before I continue...

  - Please bear with my english (I'm from Norway!:)
  - This program is called Assembler Laboratory, but in this document it
    will be called Alab for ease.

1.2 - Why starting this project
-------------------------------

For some years of assembly programming, I (as most of us) had this
cyclus during development:
ÚÚÄ> - Edit the source code in a regular editor
³³   - Save the source code (an extra keypress)
³³   - Exit the editor
³³   - Assemble the source code from the command line
³ÀÄ  - Go back to the editor if reported errors
³       (you'd have to manually jump to the different error(s))
³    - Link the .obj-file (possibly run an .bat-file or MAKE instead of
³                         assemble/link)
³    - Run the executable program
³    - Boot machine if the program hangs
ÀÄÄ  - Go back to the editor to make further modifications

This is an extremely unneccesery time consuming process, and the id‚a
popped into my mind: 'Why not make an Asm IDE (I hadn't seen anyone at
that time) where you can do all of this things without exiting the
IDE!' I had also seen the editors for Pascal/C which had syntax
highlighting, and I thought that that would be a great id‚a to have in
the Asm IDE. C also had a great error highlighting and why not also
include that in my Asm IDE? Ok, so the id‚a was born, and now I needed a
name for it. I for a long time had 'AsmIDE' as the name, but then
suddenly I saw that there already was an Asm IDE out there called AsmIDE
(hi Toby!). Ok, I had already come so far on the project so I didn't
want to cancel it. All I had to do was to make an IDE much better than
what is already out there. I ofcourse had to change the name. At first I
couldn't think of anything good, but I guess suddenly 'Assembler
Laboratory' must have just popped in (can't remember exactly). Since it
is called 'Laboratory' I also thought I had to make a bunch of extra
features (laboratory is a place where you have many different things at
your disposal), and so it was!

Here is a brief list of Assembler Laboratory features:
    - [Save/]Assemble as standalone choice (one keypress)
    - [Save/]Assemble[/Link] as standalone choice (one keypress)
    - [Save/]Assemble/Link/Run as standalone choice (one keypress)
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Error highlighting
    - Procedure worksheet (useful popup overview of procedures)
    - Macro/data Worksheet (same as proc worksheet, but for macros/data)
    - Heuristic scan (scans through source code for coding bugs, not
                      fully implemented yet)
    - Project Manager
    - Label jumps (Ctrl+J on a jump opcode (Jxx/CALL) jumps to the
                   destination)
    - Keyboard macros (not very good though)
    - Menu functions shortcut key reassignment
    - Online opcode help. Also context sensitive. (Topic Search)
    - Block comment/uncomment
    - Bookmarks
    - Ascii/scancodes table
    - Dec/Hex/Bin calculator (inspired by Toby's AsmIDE, as many other
                              things :)

... and I have also included an 'unhang' utility ('Unhang.com') which
can prevent your machine from hanging in many cases (that is, you can
press the stated keycombination when your machine hangs, and Unhang will
try to quit back to DOS.) Beware that this program can be very unstable
I think. It will not work if you either hook int 09 or disables keyboard
interrupt. It will probably not work if you run some module player in
the background, because the memory will get f***** up... What it does is
to hook int 9 and saves an exit-command at the address found on the stack
(the point where the interrupt was called). Just 'mov ax, 4c00h -
int 21h', but it works on most smaller programmes ! :) It is actually
_very_ useful when coding demos under dos for example (without sound in
the background).

1.3 - New version release notes!!
---------------------------------

So, Alab v1.2 is finally out! I hope you like it...
I had thought about calling it v2.0, but realised that I had not put
enough new features in there, and not improved it enough to make it
v2.0.

As stated before, I am still in the army (which started 19. July 1995,
I ended up on a fregatt). I have had the privilege to have a laptop at
my disposal, and so I have had some time to code further on Alab. Many
people (almost everyone) asked for NO 64Kb limit, so at first I thought
I had to give you what you wanted. I began on the NO 64Kb limit
implementation, but stopped after some time of coding. Instead I
concentrated on all the little bugs which had to be fixed, and small
features people had asked for. Now; VERY few people have registered
themselves and I am thinking of putting Alab way back in the 'to do'
list. I do not want to spend precious time coding something which is
working fine for me, when the payback is very low. During coding I
neither spent very long time optimizing and/or structuring my code.
Once it worked I jumped on the next bug/feature (you do NOT want to see
my sourcecode!;)

Now that I have fixed most bugs and added most features people asked
for (actually!), I release maybe the last for of Alab for a long time...
(I will give out bug-fixed versions in the future, but if the lack of
registrations continue you will not see any BIG new versions with lots
of new features, only bugfixed versions with a few minor upgrades)

NB! I _will_ atleast add features which registered persons ask for.

Well, I really had big plans for Alab 2.0 with features:

- No 64 Kb limit (that would be unique for asm-only IDE's I think!?)
- Big speed increase (most if this is already done though)
- Templates
- Macros which works (not the shit you find in this version)
- Built in menus configuration
- Full Masm/A86/Dlink support
- Folding lines utility
- Major rewrite
+++ other nice features you want

, but I have temporarily burried it because of lack of registrations. A
temporary burrial which might become 'not so very temporary anymore'
very soon, if the lack of registrations lasts...

If YOU reading this register yourselves there's already a much better
chance you'll see a new version of Alab in near future.

(I expect something in return for my nearly 2 years of work...)

Because I'm in the army, you will have to pass your
messages/id‚as/suggestions to Haavard Engum (hobbes/xenon), Joakim
Nygaard (who is the coordinator of the new main WWW), or Espen Grimsgaard
(twinny/gollum) who is the coordinator of the old WWW (is at the end of
this doc). The best way is to write an e-mail to Haavard Engum. His
e-mail address comes at the end of this document.

[ 2 - Installation ]
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

  - Copy all the files to the directory where you wish to have Alab
  - Include the directory in your path if you want (also easiest to do
    in your autoexec.bat)

Now Alab is ready to go. The first thing you should do when you start
Alab, is to go to the Options|Programs and set the path to where your
Tasm/Masm/Dlink etc... executables are.

[ 3 - Command line switches ]
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

file(s) : specify files to directly open in Alab.
/K      : reload keys defined in KEYS.MAC and store them in ALAB.CFG.
          (this is very imported to remember if you redefine keys!)

[ 4 - Features ]
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

4.1 - Procedure/macro Worksheet
-------------------------------

Procedure/macro Worksheet is a completely new feature in low level
programming IDE's. It is a popup menu with complete procedure overview.
Here you have a nice list of all the procedures in the current
source code, and by pressing [Space], you jump directly to the item the
bar is on! Well, you maybe are familar with something like this.
Borland Pascal have a browser which is quite similar to this. The reason
why I call it 'worksheet' is because I at first had planned to implement
procedure/macro reordering and delete... Then it would be more like a
worksheet and not a browser.

4.2 - Heuristic Scan
--------------------

I actually got this id‚a from the famous virus-scanner F-PROT. What
Heuristic Scan does, is to scan through the sourcecode and look for
bugs which wasn't reported by the compiler, and is likely to cause some
problems. F.ex. it scans for missing 'ret's in procedures (which is
likely to hang your program). This is the only thing in Heuristic Scan
so far, but I have some more id‚as to it, and I will most probably get
many id‚as from you out there. (F.ex. I have planned to make Heuristic
Scan scan for places where it is possible that DS doesn't point to the
data-segment (or the segment where the variable is) when accessing
variables (this is also in many cases a hang-cause).

4.3 - Block comment/uncomment
-----------------------------

This feature is pretty much self-explanatory. You mark a block, and
choose Block comment from the menu or shortcut-keys, and ....! The block
is commented. I guess uncomment is obvious at this time :)

4.4 - Label Jumps
-----------------

This is a nice one! You just position the cursor on a line that holds
a CALL or Jxx (all jump opcodes), and press Ctrl+J. The cursor then
jumps to the procedure or label succeding the opcode.

4.5 - Online Opcode Help
------------------------

Also a nice one! On the Help|Opcodes you have a very extensive online
help on the instruction set. Just choose one and there you have it all,
just as detailed as any TSR. There also is context sensitive help on
this. Position the cursor on a word and press the command for Topic
Search (Shift+F1 as default). Help for that specific opcode is
automatically brought up.

4.6 - Tab characters
--------------------

I do not use true tab characters in my source codes, and therefore I
have not bothered to put in support for smart tabs when the 'Use tab
characters' checkbox is checked in Options|Editor (i'm too lazy, and I
just want to get Alab out now!) That is; smart tabs is only available
when using spaces instead of true tab characters.

Also; the tab step when using true tab characters is always 8, no
matter what you type in the 'Tab size' box in Options|Editor.

4.7 - Redefining shortcut keys in menus
---------------------------------------

Actually very easy. Just follow the instructions in KEYS.MAC. The
reason why I mention it here, is because people seem to not notice
that it says you have to start Alab with the '/K' switch in order to
make the changes take effect! Remember that... Also, you must not
reorder the function names in any way! Alab does not recognize the
function names.

4.8 - Bookmarks
---------------

This is a great new feature added to Alab. The principle is the same as
the usual bookmarks for books. Sometimes (very often for many) you want
to mark a position in your sourcecode, and return to that position
later. Bookmarks makes this an easy task. Just choose Search|Place
bookmark, or press "Ctrl+Q n" (where n is a number between 1 and 9), and
Alab places a bookmark at the current cursor position. You can have up
to 9 bookmarks for each window. When you want to jump to a bookmark,
choose Search|Jump to bookmark, or press "Ctrl+Q J n" (where n is the
bookmark-number), and Alab places the cursor on the line where the
bookmark is. In the registered version, you will also have the
opportunity to save the bookmarks, so you can return to the bookmarks
after exiting from Alab.

[ 5 - Project Manager ]
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

First I have to say that I haven't used the Project Manager so much
myself, and therefore it may not work 100%.

5.1 - What is it?
-----------------

Project Manager lets you create and maintain a project file (extension
.APF for Alab Project File) where you specify all the .asm, .obj and
.lib files which are to be included in your program. If you specify an
.asm file in your project YOU DO NOT HAVE TO specify the .obj file
created from that .asm file! With Project Manager it gets easy to
maintain your program, and easy to link/run it.

5.2 - Creating a project file
-----------------------------

Lets say you are starting on a program with 3-4 source files, 2
additional object files you have got from a friend with video routines
etc., and 1 of your own library files. You then first choose Open on the
Project menu and type in the name for the project file (the name of the
project file will be used to create an .exe/.com file). You then get an
open Project Manager window with no files in it. Press Insert or choose
Add Item from the menu to insert new items. Insert the 3-4 source files,
the 2 object files and the library file. Then you can go to one of the
source file and press ENTER to open it (or choose Open from the File
menu). You then write your source code in it and assembles it the usual
way. You do this with the other .asm files also.

5.3 - Making a project
----------------------

When you choose Make and you have an open project, the Project Manager
goes through the files specified in the project file (project window),
top to bottom, and do this: If the file is a source file (.asm) the
Project Manager checks wether the source file is modified. If it is, the
file is assembled and the .obj file created is added to the parameters
which will be passed to the linker later. If the file is a .obj or a
.lib file, the file is added to the parameters to pass to the linker.
Then when the Project Manger has gone through all the files, the linker
is invoked and an executable is created. The name of the executable will
be the same as the name of the project file.

[ 6 - FAQ and Known bugs ]
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
  - I don't know what the hell happended to the ascii chart!
    The cursor movement worked during very early versions of Alab
    (not released versions).
  - Not actually a bug, but lots of useless code in there!
    (and code which is never used too..)
  - Not support for Masm in project.
  - Calculator don't handle negativ decimal->hex+some more bugs (don't
    use too big numbers...)
  - Project Manager:
      You have to specify full path to include files in the source files
      in most cases.
  - Dos screen doesn't work on a monochrom screen (who has that anyway?)

  - Some other small bugs which I cannot remember right now.

6.1 - Alab hangs when I open a window!
--------------------------------------

The cause for this is most probably that you don't have a 386+, and that
the syntax highlighting checkbox is checked in Options|Editor. What
happens is that syntax highlighting uses 386 code, and this will hang
your machine. You will have to turn off syntax highlighting and clear
the 'Highlight extensions' field in Options|Editor before you open any
windows.

6.2 - How can I get Alab to work properly on a network?
-------------------------------------------------------

If you run Alab on a network station, from a public read only directory,
you have to specify a new ERROR.LST output directory. This is the file
to which Alab redirects all output from the assemblers and linkers, and
which Alab reads to get all errors. Since Alab uses the Alab directory
as the default directory for ERROR.LST, Alab hangs when it tries to write
to a readonly directory, and so you have to specify a local read/write
directory to get Alab to work properly. The option for this is in
Options|Directores.

I'm 20 years old and live in Trondheim, Norway.
Currently in the army, next year hopefully student at Trondheim School
of Engineering. A.k.a. Ghoul / Xenon Development.
I've been programming since I was 15/16... I started late, but have
learned *a lot* in short time.

If you have suggestions/questions/problems about Alab you will have to
write a message either to Haavard Engum (the best way) or leave a
message on the 1st WWW page. (you can also write a message to the other
Xenon Members).


  NB! NEW email address to Haavard Engum!

  Email    : hobbes@interlink.no (the old one was hobbes@infolink.no)
               This is the email address to Haavard Engum, a.k.a.
               Hobbes/Xenon Development. He will make sure I get all the
               requests in time.


  WWW page 1 : http://www.idb.hist.no/~joakimn/ This is the new main one!

             Eldritch BBS      +47-72582079 (23:00-07:00)

             You'll find both me and Haavard on these BBS'es.

Norwegians:
  NDC.Alab konferansen ble ingen suksess ;)

You can always mail me at my home address, but it's nok likely I'll get
your letter until 3-6 weeks.

NB! Please support the development of Alab by registering if you like
    it!

Last minute notes:
I know there's a lot of bad programming in there now. I will rewrite
most of Alab if a new _big_ version is ever to come out (again: depends
heavy on the amounts of registrations)
