                  UPGRADE FORM FOR ASSEMBLER LABORATORY

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

        NB! This doesn't take effect until the next version. I will send
        all of you who have already registered v1.0, a registered
        version 1.2 for free.

        If you just want to upgrade your already registered earlier
        version of Alab, fill out this form, pay the price, and send the
        form either by e-mail to Haavard Engum or by snailmail.

        Pay the upgrade price of ALAB using following methods:

        ------------------------- NORWAY ---------------------------------

        You can pay with cash, cheque or money transfer to one of my
        accounts.

         Bank account ("giro" bank) : 82306010944
         Post account (postgiro)    : 08250698330

        Or you can make a cheque payable to the author and send it to
        Haavard Engum.

        The upgrade fee is 30,- NKR (norske kroner).
        No matter how many copies you have purchased earlier, you just
        have to pay these 30,- NKR.

        All amounts includes postal fees etc.

               +-----------------------------------------------+
               | This price is valid only for Norwegian orders |
               +-----------------------------------------------+

        To make things faster, send a copy of the bank/post giro with this
        upgrade form. Then I will know you have paid me without going to
        the bank and I can send you ALAB right away...

        ---------------------- OUTSIDE NORWAY ----------------------------

        The upgrade fee is $5 (US Dollars).
        No matter how many copies you have purchased earlier, you just
        have to pay these $5.

        All amounts includes postal fees etc.

        Pay with cash, cheque or money-transfer to my one of my accounts

         Bank account ("giro" bank) : 82306010944
         Post account (postgiro)    : 08250698330

        If there are problems with this paying method, you will have to
        make a cheque payable to me (the author). Send it to Haavard
        Engum.

        To make things faster, also send the receipt you receive upon
        payment. I will then be able to send ALAB you faster.

HAAVARD ENGUMS' ADDRESS:

        Send this form (and perhaps a copy of the receipt) (and perhaps
        a cheque) either by snailmail or e-mail to:

        Haavard Engum
        Stokkanhaugen 164
        7048 Trondheim
        NORWAY

        e-mail: hobbes@interlink.no

        Phone: +47-73943417

        When Haavard Engum receives this form (and he have checked that
        the fee is payed) he will send you the latest registered version
        of Alab. Still, if you have not registered yourself before, you
        won't be able to use the version I send you because it uses the
        old registrated KEY-file which only registered users have.
