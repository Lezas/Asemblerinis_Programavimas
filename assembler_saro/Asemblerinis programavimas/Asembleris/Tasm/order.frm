컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

        To get either a non-commercial, commercial or educational license
        to use ALAB, you need to fill this order form and mail it with
        signed Licence Agreement (LICENSE.TXT) to Haavard Engum. Only
        printed form is acceptable.

        Non-commercial license:
          This is a license to use ALAB in development of non-commercial
          products. Shareware is in this case considered a non-commercial
          program (even if it really is not).

        Commercial license: (read! it has changed)
          This is a license to use ALAB in development of ANY commercial
          programs. No matter have small/big/cheap/expensive your program
          is, you must use this license.
          NEW: A company now needs to purchase one copy for each machine
          ALAB is going to be used on. There are discounts for purchasing
          of several licenses (se below). You only need to fill out the
          name of the company, along with the address/phone to the company.

        Educational license:
          This is a license to use ALAB for educational purposes. You
          need to purchase one copy for each machine ALAB is going to
          be used on. There are discounts (se below).

        After you have filled the form correctly, pay the
        price of ALAB using following methods:

        ------------------------- NORWAY ---------------------------------

        You can pay with cash, cheque or money transfer to one of my
        accounts.

         Bank account ("giro" bank) : 82306010944
         Post account (postgiro)    : 08250698330

        Or you can make a cheque payable to the author and send it to
        Haavard Engum.

        Non-commercial amount: 100,- NKR (norske kroner)
        Commercial amount    : 420,- NKR (norske kroner)
          Purchasing of several copies (commercial licenses):
            (420 NKR * number of copies) / 2
            (210 NKR * number of copies)        <- price to pay

        Educational amount:
          ((Non-commercial amount) * (number of copies)) / 2
          (50 NKR * number of copies)           <- price to pay

        That is, you get 50% discount of the full price.

        All amounts includes postal fees etc.

               +-----------------------------------------------+
               | This price is valid only for Norwegian orders |
               +-----------------------------------------------+

        To make things faster, send a copy of the bank/post giro with this
        order form. Then I will know you have paid me without going to
        the bank and I can send you ALAB right away...

        ---------------------- OUTSIDE NORWAY ----------------------------

        In version 1.0 I heard there were some problems with paying from
        forreign countries. Now you can pay with cheque so there
        shouldn't be any problems...

        Non-commercial amount: 15 USD (US dollars)
        Commercial amount    : 60 USD (US dollars)
          Purchasing of several copies (commercial licenses):
            (60 USD * number of copies) / 2
            (30 USD * number of copies)         <- price to pay

        Educational amount:
          ((Non-commercial amount) * (number of copies)) / 2
          (7.5 USD * number of copies)          <- price to pay

        That is, you get 50% discount of the full price.

        All amounts includes postal fees etc.

        Pay with cash, cheque or money-transfer to my one of my accounts

         Bank account ("giro" bank) : 82306010944
         Post account (postgiro)    : 08250698330

        If there are problems with this paying method, you will have to
        make a cheque payable to me (the author). Send it with the
        license agreement and ORDER.FRM to Haavard Engum.

        To make things faster, also send the receipt you receive upon
        payment. I will then be able to send ALAB you faster.

        -------------------------- UPGRADING ---------------------------

        If you already have registered yourself, you can purchase a
        registered copy of the latest version of Alab by paying a small
        upgrade fee. Just fill out UPGRADE.FRM (you don't have to fill
        out LICENSE.TXT), and send it to Haavard Engum.

        NB! This is from the next version and on. I will send everybody
        who have registered version 1.0 a registered version 1.2.

HAAVARD ENGUMS' ADDRESS:

        receipt) (and perhaps a cheque) to:
